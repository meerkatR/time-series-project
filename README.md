# Time Series Analysis Project

## Data
1. The data set [alc.csv](https://github.com/meerkatR/time-series-project/blob/master/alc.csv) contains the montly amount of alcohol wholesale in (in $1, 000, 000â€™s) in the U.S. from January 2002 until December 2008.
1. The data set [homicide.csv](https://github.com/meerkatR/time-series-project/blob/master/homicide.csv) contains the monthly count of homicides in Cali, Colombia from January 1999 through August 2008.
1. The data set [erie.dat](https://github.com/meerkatR/time-series-project/blob/master/erie.dat) contains monthly Lake Erie levels from 1921 through 1970.
1. In a gas furnace, air and methane are combined to form a mixture of gasses, including co2. The data [methane.dat](https://github.com/meerkatR/time-series-project/blob/master/methane.dat) contains the methane input (cu. ft/min) into a gas furnace; the data [co2.dat](https://github.com/meerkatR/time-series-project/blob/master/co2.dat) contains the contemporaneously measured percentage of carbon dioxide measured in the output. Sampling occurred every 9 seconds.

## Model and Prediction
1. Fit a seasonal ARIMA model to predict monthly alcohol sales for each month in 2009.
1. Fit a ARIMA model to predict homicide for the first 12 months of 2009.
1. Fit a seasonal ARIMA model to predict Lake Erie levels for March of 1971, 1972, and 1973.
1. Fit a lagged regression model to predict co2 output in a gas furnace using methane input and previous co2 output.
